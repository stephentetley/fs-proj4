Making Proj4 on Windows

Download an unpack the archive

Instructions are in the README, section "### Building on Windows with NMAKE".

Note be sure to edit `PROJ\nmake.opt` first, set INSTDIR to something like: 

INSTDIR=e:\coding\libs\proj-5.2.0_bin


Build with the Visual Studio shell ``x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017``, see rEADME for commands.

Edit the environment variable PROJ_LIB in Windows Settings.

Download datum gridfiles and put in LIB/share directory.
Especially you must have `conus` from proj-datumgrid-XX.zip and proj-datumgrid-europe-XX

Having proj-datumgrid-north-america-XX is proabably wise when working with examples.
